# Moovera

* Media
COMING SOON

## About this Project
Streaming movies app. You can create and login in your account, explore movies, search , add to favorites and play. 

!! Since the search bar its only to show the implementation of filtering , I made it filter only movies from POPULAR category. <br>
!! TMDB doesn't can't share real movies links, so I used the same animation for every movie, just to show Media Player implemetation. 

## Why ? 
I decided to create "Moovera" to study Flutter and Dart. Now it's part of my personal portfolio, so any feedback about the project, code, structure or anything else will be very welcome!
